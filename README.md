#### About

Welcome to Girls Who Ball, an interactive place for girls to learn about football!

#### How to Navigate

There is some built in data points, but essentially, users are supposed to add players to a team, and do so with relevant player information.

#### Installation Instructions

To use this program, go to your terminal and enter the following.

bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

That should load the backend and data. Following,

rails s (runs the rails server)

Lastly, navigate to the frontend folder:

open index.html (opens the index or view-type page which you can interact with)

In order to complete the last two steps, make sure you have two tabs open in your terminal.
